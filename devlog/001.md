# Devlog 001 - Oct 18, 2022

Current Status :: part 008 in progress

For the last little while I've been working on a [2d Space Shooter game](https://github.com/patrickodacre/odin-space-shooter).

Before starting this Space Shooter series I had only attempted making a 2d adventure-rpg-type game. And with that I have only gotten as far as implementing a basic tilemap and collision detection.

Since a top-down rpg is a fairly complicated game, I wanted to tackle something a little smaller in scope, so I could actually finish something in a reasonable amount of time.

Some time ago I had found a series of [SDL tutorials on itch.io](https://parallelrealities.itch.io/sdl2-tutorials). This series covers making games with SDL2 and the C programming language. I'm not completing the tutorials in C, but rather, I'm trying to recreate some of the game ideas using Odin.

I'm writing everything myself, and my code is quite different from that found in the tutorials, so if you have a mind to check out the original tutorials, you should.
